      <description>Orvyn Research exists to document independent research on systematic trading, algorithmic strategies, and applied quantitative methods.&#xA;The project was initiated to create a structured environment for exploring, testing, and refining research ideas through implementation and documentation. The focus is on methodology, assumptions, and results rather than outcomes. The project also serves as a framework for continuous improvement of research practices over time.&#xA;Content published here may include:&#xA;Research notes and experiment logs Simple strategy prototypes and backtests Observations on data, modeling choices, and limitations Orvyn Research does not provide investment advice or trading signals.</description>
